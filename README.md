Second Project with OOP and also used pointers.

 IN this project, I used some oop and pointers to make every thing connected with each other.
 
 Currently, the system has 2 users.
 admin: username is "admin" password is "123".
 normal user: username is "youssef" password is "222".
 
 I hope there are no bugs or any memory leak :")
